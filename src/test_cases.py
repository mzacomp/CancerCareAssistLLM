    "question": "What are the phases of a clinical trial?",
    "expected": """Clinical trials are done in phases, from Phase 1 through 4. Each phase gathers information about the safety of the treatment and how well it works:

- Phase 1: The new treatment is tested for safety and to find out what dose works best without causing severe side effects.
- Phase 2: The new treatment is tested to see if it works against certain types of cancer.
- Phase 3: The new treatment is compared to standard treatment to see which might work better for certain cancers. At this point, researchers don't know which treatment is better, so about half of the people in the clinical trial get the new treatment and the other half get standard treatment, often chosen at random (called randomized).
- Phase 4: The new treatment is studied over a longer time to learn about long-term safety and how well it works. This phase happens after the new treatment has been approved for use in certain types of cancer."""

    "question": "What are the leading risk factors for cancer in the United States?",
     "expected": """
Nearly half of cancer deaths in the US can be attributed to potentially modifiable behavioral risk factors, the most important of which are tobacco use, excess body weight, and alcohol consumption

The leading risk factors for cancer in the United States include:

1. Tobacco Use: Tobacco remains the most preventable cause of cancer, with smoking increasing the risk of at least 12 types of cancers. Cigarette smoking alone is responsible for more than 80% of lung and laryngeal cancers and 50% of esophagus, oral/nasal cavity, and urinary bladder cancers. The prevalence of smoking has decreased over the years, but it remains a significant risk factor.

2. Excess Body Weight: Being overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) is associated with an increased risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal, oral cavity, esophagus, pharynx, and larynx cancers. The prevalence of excess body weight has been on the rise among adults and youth in recent years.

3. Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol intake is linked to an increased risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colorectum, female breast, and stomach. In 2022, a significant percentage of adults reported current drinking, with a smaller percentage engaging in heavy drinking.

Avoiding tobacco use, maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, consuming a healthy diet, and avoiding or limiting alcohol intake are the most effective strategies for reducing cancer risk.

    "question":"What are some coping strategies for dealing with a cancer diagnosis?", 
    "expected": """" Some coping strategies for dealing with a cancer diagnosis include:

1. Expressing Your Feelings: Talk with trusted friends or relatives, or keep a journal. Some people find comfort in expressing their feelings through creative outlets like music, painting, or drawing.

2. Taking Care of Yourself: Make time to do something enjoyable every day.

3. Staying Physically Active: Engage in activities you enjoy, as long as your cancer care team agrees it's safe. Even a short walk can help reduce stress.

4. Reaching Out for Support: Connect with friends, family, spiritual leaders, or support organizations.

5. Communicating with Your Cancer Care Team: Discuss any concerns or feelings of anxiety or depression with your cancer care team so they can help you manage your emotions.

6. Considering Counseling or Support Groups: Look into in-person or virtual options for counseling or joining a cancer support group.

{
    "question": "What are some ways to manage medical costs from cancer care?",
     "expected": """Some ways to manage medical costs from cancer care include:

1. Understanding Medical Costs: Familiarize yourself with your medical costs related to cancer care, including treatment options and their associated expenses.

2. Organizing Medical Bills and Statements: Keep track of all medical bills and statements to ensure accuracy and to help manage your expenses effectively.

3. Seeking Financial Assistance: Look for financial assistance programs that may be available to help cover the costs of cancer treatment and related expenses.

4. Discussing Treatment Options: Talk to your cancer care team about the costs associated with different treatment options. Understanding the financial implications can help you make informed decisions.

5. Palliative Care: Consider incorporating palliative care into your treatment plan, which can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life, potentially reducing the need for more expensive interventions later.

6. Getting a Second Opinion: If you're uncertain about your treatment plan, obtaining a second opinion may provide additional options that could be more cost-effective.

7. Saving on Medications: Explore ways to save money on pain medicine and other prescriptions, such as using generic versions or patient assistance programs.

These strategies can help you navigate the financial aspects of cancer care more effectively.

{
    "question": "How should people with cancer navigate getting the COVID-19 vaccine?",
    "expected": """
Cancer patients are urged to get COVID-19 vaccinations and booster shots as recommended by CDC, NCCN, and other cancer-related organizations. It is important for patients undergoing active cancer treatment to discuss vaccination with their healthcare team, as there may be specific considerations regarding the timing and effectiveness of the vaccine during treatment [6]. Additionally, patients should be aware that getting vaccinated does not cause cancer to recur or make it more aggressive, and it is safe to receive the vaccine even if they have conditions like lymphedema from surgery. However, for patients who have just had a stem-cell transplant or received CAR T-cell therapy, who are typically receiving immunosuppressive therapy, we continue to recommend that they delay COVID-19 vaccination(or revaccination as is recommended for patients undergoing these therapies) until at least 3 months after they’ve completed treatment. It is advisable for patients to consult with their healthcare providers about these issues to make informed decisions. Family members and caregivers of cancer patients are also encouraged to get vaccinated to help protect those with cancer.
