    "question": "What are the phases of a clinical trial?",
    "expected_answer": "Clinical trials are done in phases, from Phase 1 through 4. Each phase gathers information about the safety of the treatment and how well it works:\n\n- Phase 1: The new treatment is tested for safety and to find out what dose works best without causing severe side effects.\n- Phase 2: The new treatment is tested to see if it works against certain types of cancer.\n- Phase 3: The new treatment is compared to standard treatment to see which might work better for certain cancers. At this point, researchers don't know which treatment is better, so about half of the people in the clinical trial get the new treatment and the other half get standard treatment, often chosen at random (called randomized).\n- Phase 4: The new treatment is studied over a longer time to learn about long-term safety and how well it works. This phase happens after the new treatment has been approved for use in certain types of cancer.",
    "model_answer": "Clinical trials are conducted in phases, from Phase 1 through 4. Phase 1 focuses on testing the new treatment for safety and determining the best dose without severe side effects. Phase 2 assesses the treatment's effectiveness against specific cancer types. Phase 3 compares the new treatment to the standard treatment to determine which is more effective for certain cancers. Phase 4 involves studying the new treatment over an extended period to understand its long-term safety and efficacy after approval for specific cancer types[3].",

    "question": "What are the leading risk factors for cancer in the United States?",
    "expected_answer": "\nNearly half of cancer deaths in the US can be attributed to potentially modifiable behavioral risk factors, the most important of which are tobacco use, excess body weight, and alcohol consumption\n\nThe leading risk factors for cancer in the United States include:\n\n1. Tobacco Use: Tobacco remains the most preventable cause of cancer, with smoking increasing the risk of at least 12 types of cancers. Cigarette smoking alone is responsible for more than 80% of lung and laryngeal cancers and 50% of esophagus, oral/nasal cavity, and urinary bladder cancers. The prevalence of smoking has decreased over the years, but it remains a significant risk factor.\n\n2. Excess Body Weight: Being overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) is associated with an increased risk of developing various cancers, including colorectal, oral cavity, esophagus, pharynx, and larynx cancers. The prevalence of excess body weight has been on the rise among adults and youth in recent years.\n\n3. Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol intake is linked to an increased risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colorectum, female breast, and stomach. In 2022, a significant percentage of adults reported current drinking, with a smaller percentage engaging in heavy drinking.\n\nAvoiding tobacco use, maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, consuming a healthy diet, and avoiding or limiting alcohol intake are the most effective strategies for reducing cancer risk.\n\n ",
    "model_answer": "The leading risk factors for cancer in the United States include tobacco use, excess body weight, and alcohol consumption[6]. Tobacco use remains the most preventable cause of cancer, with a significant impact on various types of cancers, especially lung cancer. Excess body weight is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple cancers, while alcohol consumption is linked to cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colorectum, female breast, and stomach. Maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, consuming a healthy diet, and limiting alcohol intake are effective strategies for reducing cancer risk[8]. These modifiable risk factors play a crucial role in cancer prevention and highlight the importance of lifestyle choices in reducing cancer incidence.",

    "question": "How should people with cancer navigate getting the COVID-19 vaccine?",
    "expected_answer": "\nCancer patients are urged to get COVID-19 vaccinations and booster shots as recommended by CDC, NCCN, and other cancer-related organizations. It is important for patients undergoing active cancer treatment to discuss vaccination with their healthcare team, as there may be specific considerations regarding the timing and effectiveness of the vaccine during treatment [6]. Additionally, patients should be aware that getting vaccinated does not cause cancer to recur or make it more aggressive, and it is safe to receive the vaccine even if they have conditions like lymphedema from surgery. However, for patients who have just had a stem-cell transplant or received CAR T-cell therapy, who are typically receiving immunosuppressive therapy, we continue to recommend that they delay COVID-19 vaccination(or revaccination as is recommended for patients undergoing these therapies) until at least 3 months after they’ve completed treatment. It is advisable for patients to consult with their healthcare providers about these issues to make informed decisions. Family members and caregivers of cancer patients are also encouraged to get vaccinated to help protect those with cancer.\n\n ",
    "model_answer": "People with cancer should follow the recommendations from the CDC, NCCN, and other cancer-related organizations to get COVID-19 vaccinations and booster shots[5]. It is essential for cancer patients, survivors, and those undergoing active treatment to prioritize getting vaccinated unless advised otherwise by their healthcare team[6]. Concerns about the vaccine causing cancer, affecting cancer treatment effectiveness, or causing a rise in tumor markers are not supported by current evidence[7]. Family members and caregivers of individuals with cancer are also encouraged to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones[9]. As the situation evolves, the approach to vaccination and booster shots may change, so staying informed through reliable sources is crucial[10].",
